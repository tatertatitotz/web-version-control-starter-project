#.gitignore file tells Git which files and folders to ignore (not track).
# This is useful for keeping log files, temporary files, build artifacts, or personal files out of your repository.
# Use when
# - you want to keep sensitive, local, or unnecessary files out of your repository
# - sharing a project with others and want to avoid cluttering Git history
# - working with build tools or editors that create extra files
